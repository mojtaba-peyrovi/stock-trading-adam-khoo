### Some strategies

- He takes the best performing sectors and worst ones and find the high quality companies within hated stocks and buy them for cheap, and sell overpriced stocks for expensive. The next year, the bad performing sectors switch to be best performing and the stock we bought last year grow so much.

- Peter Lynch had the same strategy. He bought what was hated, and quickly lost a big percentage of the money but afterwards he made a big gain. This way he did 3x better performance than the market (SnP index) his annual return was 29% a year.

## 7 rules to outperform the hedge funds and big professional fund management companies:

1- Only invest in the TOP 1% of stocks when they are significantly undervalued. There are criterias for this, later on we will explain. 
<br>
2- When there is nothing great to invest in, DON'T INVEST. Be patient for opportunities
<br>
3- Short term volatility is your friend. Be greedy when others are fearful. When the market gets volatile and drops suddenly, dont be scared, buy more of them for cheap price. It is exciting not scary. (only if they are good companies)
<br>
4- Keep holding stock through short term volatility. do not jump in and out. Have long term view to grow your wealth. 
<br>
5- Hold on to winning stocks as long as the underlying business remains great. Great companies can grow 10 times. stocks like Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe, etc.
<br>
6- Use options to turbocharge your returns (e.g. covered calls, cash secured puts)
<br>
7- Ignore the macroeconomic news and the predictions of experts.

Some of the stocks that he has in his portfolio that he believes are within the top 1%:

- Mercadolibre MELI
- ASML ASML
- ServiceNow NOW
- Autozone AZO
- Microsoft MSFT
- Amazon AMZN
- Meta META
- google GOOGL
- Palantir technologies PLTR
- Booking Holdings BKNG
- Mastercard Inc MA

If you invest only in good companies, you will always grow, even through the worst economic situations, wars, etc. If the business is powerful, those only noises. 


### VALUE MOMENTUM INVESTING: 
This is his strategy and it contains four keys:

    - What to buy: You must know what to buy -> Only 1% of stocks are investable. 99% are non-investable.
    - When to buy: A good stock can be a bad investment if you pay too high price for it. (wrong purchase time)
    - How much to buy: NEVER put all your money in one business. because no matter how great the business is, shit can happen. Diversify your money into at least 8-10 great companies.
    - When to sell: many people sell too late or too early. They both miss out big returns. We sell when the stock is overpriced. then we sell and get the money and buy another stock for cheap or the same company when it again becomes cheap.



### 7 criteria to recognize if a stock is a good one (top 1%):
1- Consistant increase in sales, net income, and free cashflow for AT LEAST 5 years. This shows that the business is predictable, consistant and resiliant. In the whole world, less than 5% of companies can pass this criteria.
Businesses which go up and down a lot are terrible to invest in. For example, manufacture, airlines, commodities, shipping companies because they are unpredictable. The photo below shows how Singapore Airlines has a very high revenue but very low Net income:
<img src='./screenshots/Screenshot 2023-11-22 224323.png'>
Also, this is their free cashflow which is most of the times negative. It means they are always low in cash to pay dividend and operations costs
<img src='./screenshots/Screenshot 2023-11-22 224613.png'>

Never buy stocks of a company which is losing money.

2- __The most important one:__Sustainable competitive advantage or wide competitive moat. A business that doesn't let competitors come in and compete with them.

 - We only invest in companies who have NO competition or the competitors are insignificant.

 #### What can give a company an economic moat?
  five criteria:
  - strong brand monopoly: Those are the companies who are so loved that people don't stop using thier products or services even if they raise their prices. like Louis Vuiton. If a company lowers the prices in order to keep their market share, it is a red flag. some other companies who have a strong brand monopoly: McDonalds, Microsoft, Google. These brand always grow.
  - High customer switching cost: companies who made it expensive for customers to leave the company for another brand. It is called sticky businesses and it assures recurrent revenue. Apple is the best example. Their moat is the ecosystem they built around all their products and the cloud service they have.
  - Network effect: The more people use it, the more people want to use it. Good example of it is Meta. It owns Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. Another example is AMAZON.

  He only buys stocks if the company has at least 2-3 of the moat characteristics.

  3- Companies who have a huge growing potential. They drive growth into the future. such as Semiconductors, Cybersecurity, Healthcare, Ecommerce.

  4- Companies with convervative debt and strong cash position. During the recession, strong companies get stronger because the weak competitors get wiped out.


  Market goes up and down and price of a stock can be undervalued because of news or over priced because of good news, and this is when we buy when it is undervalued and sell with it is overvalued and it happens enough times in the market to make us rich. 
  <img src='./screenshots/Screenshot 2023-11-22 233758.png'> 

  example: Intrinsic value of Meta is around 350-400 USD, and last year it was down to 80 USD and it was the best time to buy it. It means 70% discount on meta shares.

  __IMPORTANT:__ We always wait to hear bad news about top 1% of companies and it is time to buy the stocks of that company.

  ### How to calculate the intrinsic value of a company's stock?
  He has a google sheet to sell. But I can create it myself. 

  This is how it looks:

  ### Technical Analysis:
  
  #### When do we buy the stock?
  After we pick the great top 1% stock and it meets all criteria, we wait for the bottom or NEAR the bottom of a retrace, which will be point A in the photo below. 
  <img src='./screenshots/Screenshot 2023-11-23 211916.png'>

  Remember that no one knows the exact bottom of the retrace, but as long as it is somewhere near the bottom it is good enough. 

  If we look at the monthly chart of a stock, we have deep and shallow waves. The shallow ones are pull back and corrections. 

    - Shallow waves bounce on 20 day EMA on Monthly chart

<br>
When a recession happens, it hits the 50 EMA on monthly chart and it is a bull market. usually after that deep drop it goes much higher than small waves. 

The point which is marked in red is a good time to buy:
<img src='./screenshots/Screenshot 2023-11-23 213948.png'>

Currently, by the end of 2023, there are still many companies specially in health care sector that are in 50% discount and are great choices for purchase.


### Building a diversified portfolio:
- Always put your money to at least 8-10 stocks even if it is 1000$. Put 100 in ten stocks. 
- Don't buy all shares from the same industry because the whole industry may perform weak for the whole year.

### Is it a good time for investment?

Yes we are in a very good time for investment. We are one year into the bull market and historically, bull markets last around 5.5 years.

He predicts we are going to have another 10 years of bull market and it is leading by AI and technology. This is a great time to make your fortune and retire.
